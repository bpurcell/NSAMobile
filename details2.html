            <h3>Headlap and Exposure: Basic Practice</h3>
            <p>Headlap: The vertical length of the upper portion of a slate that is covered by the butt of the slate two courses above.  Amount of headlap is determined by roof slope.</p>
            <p>Standard Headlap: North American quarries use 3-inches as the standard headlap to calculate the number of pieces of slate in a square (100 square feet of roof area).</p>
            <p>Exposure: The vertical length of the visible portion of a slate when lapped by the successive course.</p>
            
            <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
            <p>Required Headlap: The amount of headlap is now prescribed by the International Building Code. See figure below for guidance on recommended headlaps for various roof slopes.</p>
            <p>Calculating Exposure: The exposure is used for laying out the roof and chalking/marking horizontal course lines. Exposure depends on headlap, and can be calculated for any slate by subtracting the headlap (H) from the length (L), and dividing by 2. </p>
            <p>Exposure = (L – H) ÷ 2</p>
