        <h1>Eave Cant Detail</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->
    <div data-role="content">


        <h3>Basic Practice </h3>
        <p>Purpose: The butt end of each slate is raised by the course below to create 
          the field angle of the slates. Therefore an eave cant is needed under the starter 
          course slate to raise the butt end to the same angle as the other courses. </p>
        <p>Material: The cant is wood lath, a beveled wood strip, formed metal or other 
          method of raising the starter course. </p>
        <p>Location: The cant is best located under the eave flashing, drip edge or gutter 
          apron Thickness: The cant thickness is similar to the thickness of the first 
          course of slate. </p>
        <h3>Special Considerations </h3>
        <p>Purpose: Each course should conform to the field angle of the course below 
          to give support and strength to the slate and minimize infiltration of wind-blown 
          rain and snow. </p>
        <p>Drainage: Allow for incidental drainage of water from behind the cant. </p>
        <p>Location: If the cant is placed on top of the underlayment, 4' lengths with 
          gaps between will allow for drainage. </p>

        <h1>Ice Dam Detail</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->
    <div data-role="content">


        <h3>Basic Practice </h3>
        <p>Required: Ice dam protection membranes are used at the eave as required by 
          building code, and anywhere ice and snow dams can occur. They are usually self-adhering 
          modified bitumen membranes. </p>
        <p>Installation: Ice dam protection membranes are installed according to the manufacturers' 
          instructions. Some are adhered directly to the roof and onto the fascia to be 
          covered by the drip edge. Some are adhered to the top of the drip edge or gutter 
          apron. Some are then covered with the loose laid field underlayment. </p>
        <h3>Special Considerations </h3>
        <p>Location: Ice dam protection membranes are usually installed to at least 24” 
          to 36” inside of the heated wall line. </p>
        <p>Stripping In: A strip about 12” wide may be used to strip in the metal drip 
          edge where the drip edge is laid on top of the ice dam protection membrane.

        <h1>Metal Drip Detail</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->
    <div data-role="content">

        <h3>Basic Practice </h3>
        <p>Purpose: The drip edge helps guide water shedding off the edge of the roof. 
          It protects and creates a neat edge for roof deck or fascia. </p>
        <p>Material: Corrosion resistant metal is used. </p>
        <p>Installation: The metal is usually side lapped 3” and fastened at the top edge 
          every 12” to 24”. The underlayments or ice dam protection membrane should shed 
          water on top of the drip edge. </p>
        <h3>Special Considerations </h3>
        <p>Required: A drip edge may be a building code requirement, and is needed where 
          the roof deck edge is plywood or end grain lumber and where the deck edge is 
          irregular or gapped. </p>

        <h1>Underlayment Detail</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->
    <div data-role="content">

        <h3>Basic Practice </h3>
        <p>Purpose: Underlayments help shed water beyond the roof eave edge. Underlayments 
          are required by building code. </p>
        <p>Material: Asphalt saturated felts, polymer modified bitumen sheets, and synthetic 
          sheets are used. Installation: The underlayment should shed water on top of 
          the eave drip edge metal, gutter apron or other eave flashing. </p>
        <h3>Special Considerations </h3>
        <p>Quality: Quality underlayments should be used with lower roof slopes and wetter 
          roof areas. A long term service life for the underlayment is needed for a reliable 
          weather-tight roof system. </p>
        <p>Material: See Underlayments, page 7 of this Field Guide. </p>
        <p>Various Methods: Single ply, multiple ply, and adhered membranes are used.

        <h1>Starter Course Detail</h1>
    </div><!-- /header -->
    <div data-role="content">

        <h3>Basic Practice </h3>
        <p>Beginning: Installation of the slate shingles begins with laying the starter 
          course on top of cant, drip edge and underlayment. The starter course is then 
          covered with the first course, resulting in 2 layers of slate shingles at the 
          eave edge. </p>
        <p>Size: The minimum vertical dimension of the starter course is the exposed length 
          of the first course plus the appropriate headlap of 3” or 4”. The thickness 
          is the same thickness as the first course. </p>
        <p>Installation: The side joints of the starter slate offset the side joints of 
          the first course by 3”. Nail holes are located about 1_” from the top edge. 
        </p>
        <h3>Special Considerations </h3>
        <p>Purpose: The starter slate sheds water from the side joints of the first course. 
          The starter course along with the cant creates the field angle of the slate 
          shingles. </p>
        <p>Installation: Starter slates are laid with the beveled edge up or down depending 
          on local practice. </p>
